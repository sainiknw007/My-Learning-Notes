ðŸ”¹ What is a Proxy Server?

A proxy server is like a middleman between your computer (client) and the internet.

When you request a website â†’ your request goes first to the proxy server.

The proxy server forwards the request to the internet â†’ brings back the data â†’ sends it to you.

ðŸ‘‰ So your computer doesnâ€™t directly connect to the target website, it goes through the proxy.

ðŸ”¹ Why is a Proxy Server Used?
âœ… 1. Privacy & Anonymity

Hides your real IP address.

Websites see the proxyâ€™s IP, not yours.

Used for browsing securely and protecting identity.

âœ… 2. Access Control & Monitoring

Organizations use proxies to control employee/student internet use.

Can block websites (e.g., social media, gaming).

Can log browsing activity for auditing.

âœ… 3. Bypass Restrictions

Helps access geo-blocked content (like watching US-only content from India).

Helps bypass firewall restrictions in some cases.

âœ… 4. Performance (Caching)

Proxies can store (cache) frequently accessed websites.

Next time, they serve data faster without going to the internet again.

Saves bandwidth.

âœ… 5. Security

Acts as a shield between users and external servers.

Can filter malicious content before it reaches users.

Some proxies even provide encryption for secure communication.

ðŸ”¹ Simple Analogy

Imagine you want to ask a question to a teacher but donâ€™t want them to know you asked.

You tell your friend (proxy) â†’ your friend asks the teacher â†’ brings back the answer â†’ gives it to you.

The teacher only knows your friend asked, not you.
