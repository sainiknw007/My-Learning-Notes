Kubernetes is an container orchestration technology, used to orchestrate the deployment and management of hundreds and thousands of 
containers in a cluster environment.

1). Your application is highly available.
2). Hardware failure will not down application, as multiple instances of application are running on different node.
3). User traffic is load balanced across various containers.
4). When demand increases deploy more instances of the application seamlessly and within a matter of seconds.
5). Scale the number of nodes up or down.

Can do these with set of declarative object configuration files and we can do this with Kubernetes.
