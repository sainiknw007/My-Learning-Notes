In case of Virtul machine and virtulization:

we have an Hardware infrastructure 
OS installed on the hardware infra that is host operating system.

then hypervisor like ESX or virtulization of some kind.

and then virtual machine,,

Each virtual machine has its own Guest OS on it.

In virtualisation there is higher utilization of resources. 
The Virtual machine consumes higher disk space as each VM is heavy and is usually in Gigabytes in Size.

Docker container are lightweight and docker container are usually in Megabytes in size.
This allows Docker container to boot up in seconds. Whereas we know VM takes times to bootup and 
as it needs to boot up entire operating system.

Docker has less isolation as more resources are shared in container like Kernel. (OS Kernel is shared b/w all the container on one docker host).
Where VMs are completed isolation from each other as they do not reply on OS. each vm has its own VM.

Earlier we provisioned number of VMs, like for each application .
VMs for Web Server
Vms for Database server
VMs for backend server

Now we configure a virtual machine to host hundreds of thousands of docker containers.
