				Kubernetes or K8s

Kubernetes also known as K8s was built by Google based on their experience running containers in productions.
It is now an open source project and is one of the best and most popular container orchestration technologies.

			To understand Kubernetes first, you should understand.

			Container and Orchestration

Most popular container technology is Docker.

Why you need docker and what it can do for you ?
Ans: One of the issue with VMWare virtualization is :

In of the project we have set up: Virtualization 

Setup a Web Server      ------------> using node js
Setup a Database Server ------------> mongo db
Configure Messaging System like  ------------> Redis
Orchestration Tool------------>like Ansible

We need to make sure, all the services are compatible with OS version that we are planning to use.
certain services are not compatible not version of OS.

Lots of issues faces/disadvantages for virtualization and application deployment:

1. Virtual Machine (VMs) run full guest operating system.
2.they consume more CPU, memory and storage.
3. Slower startup and shutdown times compared to containers.

There are common deployment issues:

1. Operating system compatibility issue, app may run on specific OS versions.
2. if you deploy the application on a different OS (ubuntu, centos) bugs or crashes.
3. especially problems when
deploying from developer's laptop to staging 
deploying from staging env to production env.

Long setup time and 
compatibility/dependencies issue
