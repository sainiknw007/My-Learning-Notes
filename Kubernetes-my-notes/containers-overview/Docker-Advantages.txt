Container Advantages:

Traditionally Developer develop application and hand over to Operating team to deploy it in dev/uat and production environment.
They provide a set of instructions 

1).such as information about how to setup hosts
2). what prerequisite to be installed on the host.
3). how to configure dependencies

Ops team uses this guide to setup the application.
Since the Ops team did not develop the application, they struggle setting up application environment and 
and they git with number of issues. 
They work with developer team to resolve it.

With Docker developer and operation teams work hand in hand to transform the application setup guide in Dockerfile with their requirements.

This Dockerfile is used to create Docker image.

This image can run on anyhost with Docker installed on it, and it is gurantee to work in same way.
So now the Operations team can now use the Docker image to deploy the application.
