Container vs Image:

What is an Docker Image ?
Docker Image is a package or a template, just like a VM template.
Image is used to create one or more containers.


Containers are running instances of images that are isolated and have their own environments and set of processes.

Docker images are available on docker hub, if you do not find any image that you want.
You can create your own customer image.
