A node is machine, physical or virtual on which Kubernetes is installed.
A node is a worker machine and that is where containers will be launched by Kubernetes.

Node was known as minions in the past.

What if your nodes on which application is running goes down, application will also go down.
that's why you need to have more than one node.

Cluster is a group of nodes grouped together. This way even if one node falls you have your application still accessible 
from the other nodes.
Multiple nodes share load as well.

Now we have a Cluster now.
