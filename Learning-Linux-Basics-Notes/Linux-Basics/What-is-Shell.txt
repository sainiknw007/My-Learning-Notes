What is Shell ? What , how and why ?

What is Shell ? (Command line interpreter)
A Linux shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and the Linux operating system (kernel).
It lets you type commands, which the shell interprets and passes to the OS for execution.

Linux shell is a program, Think of it as the command-line interpreter for Linux.

Why do we need a Shell?

The kernel (core of Linux/Unix) only understands very low-level instructions (system calls).

Writing system calls directly is complex.

Shell gives us a human-friendly interface (text based interface)to interact with the OS.

How does a Shell work?

Example: When you type ls -l

How Shell works :Real time example:

If you open a terminal in Linux and type:

ls -l 

The shell interprets it, asks the kernel to execute it, and shows the result.

What is shell scripting ?

What , how and why ?

Scripting – Shells support scripting (writing .sh files) to automate repetitive tasks.

Types of Shells –

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) → Most common default shell.

sh (Bourne Shell) → Original Unix shell.

zsh → Extended shell with extra features.

csh/tcsh → C-like syntax shell.

fish → User-friendly interactive shell.

Korn shell
