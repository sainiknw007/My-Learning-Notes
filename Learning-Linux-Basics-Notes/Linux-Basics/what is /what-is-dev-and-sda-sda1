What is /dev ? What is mount ? mount creates partition in harddrive.

/dev – Device Director
In Linux, everything is treated as a file – even your keyboard, mouse, hard disk, and USB drives.
/dev is a special folder that contains device files – these are not normal text files, but interfaces to your hardware.

Think of /dev as the control room where Linux keeps shortcuts to all connected devices.

/dev/sda1 is your first disk’s first partition (most likely where your OS is installed).

Examples of /dev Contents:
| File in `/dev` | What It Represents                      | Example Use                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/dev/sda`     | First hard disk                         | Used to access the whole disk |
| `/dev/sda1`    | First partition on first hard disk      | Mounted as `/` or `/home`     |
| `/dev/sdb1`    | First partition on second disk (or USB) | Mounted at `/mnt/usb`         |
| `/dev/null`    | "Black hole" device (discards data)     | `echo "test" > /dev/null`     |
| `/dev/random`  | Random number generator                 | Used in cryptography          |
| `/dev/tty`     | Terminal device                         | Used for console input/output |

/dev/sda1 – Your Disk Partition

Let’s break the name down:
sd → Stands for SCSI Disk (applies to SATA, NVMe too nowadays).
a → First disk (if you had multiple disks, they’d be sdb, sdc, etc.).
1 → First partition on that disk.

So:
/dev/sda → The entire first disk.
/dev/sda1 → The first slice (partition) of that disk.

Real-Life Example:

Imagine your hard disk as a book:

/dev/sda = the whole book.

/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 = chapters (partitions) in the book.

Linux mounts these partitions to directories so you can use them.

Example:
mount /dev/sda1 /
Means: attach partition sda1 to root directory /.

How to See This on Your System
Run:
lsblk
Example output:
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0   50G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0   48G  0 part /
└─sda2   8:2    0    2G  0 part [SWAP]

Here:
sda = 50GB disk
sda1 = 48GB partition (mounted at /)
sda2 = 2GB partition (used for swap memory)

Real-Time Example

Imagine you have:
One main SSD → /dev/sda
One USB drive → /dev/sdb1
One external HDD → /dev/sdc1
When you plug in the USB, Linux creates a new device file under /dev/ (like /dev/sdb1), so you can mount and use it.

In short:
/dev is where Linux keeps "shortcuts" to hardware.
/dev/sda1 is your first disk’s first partition (most likely where your OS is installed).
