Linux filesystem ?
The Linux filesystem is the way Linux organizes and manages data save n retrive (files, directories) on your computer.
Unlike Windows (which uses C:\, D:\ drives), 
Linux uses a single root directory / — everything starts from there.

The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical tree starting from /, following a standard structure, and can use multiple filesystem types 
like ext4, xfs, btrfs depending on needs.

| Filesystem Type        | Where You See It        | Example Use                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **ext4** (most common) | Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS  | Default for root (`/`) partition                  |
| **xfs**                | RHEL, Fedora            | Often used for servers (large files, scalability) |
| **btrfs**              | SUSE, Fedora (optional) | Snapshots, rollback features                      |
| **vfat / exFAT**       | USB drives              | Cross-platform with Windows                       |
| **tmpfs**              | `/tmp`, `/run`          | Stores data in RAM for faster access              |
| **nfs**                | Mounted network drives  | Shared storage in enterprise environments         |

Check Filesystem Type
df -Th

df -Th → Shows mounted filesystems, types, and usage.
Example Output:

Filesystem     Type  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      ext4   50G   12G   36G  25% /
tmpfs          tmpfs  2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm

Check Filesystem Type
df -Th


df -Th → Shows mounted filesystems, types, and usage.
Example Output:

Filesystem     Type  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      ext4   50G   12G   36G  25% /
tmpfs          tmpfs  2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm

See Mount Points
mount | grep "^/"

Shows which device is mounted where.
Example:

/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime)
/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/data type xfs (rw,relatime)
