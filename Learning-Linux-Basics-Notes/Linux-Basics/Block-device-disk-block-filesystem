Disk Block: 
The smallest unit of data storage on a physical disk (usually 4KB). 
Think of it as a single "tile" in a giant mosaic.

Block Device: (hardware device that stores data in fixed-size blocks,)
A block device in Linux is a type of hardware device that stores data in fixed-size blocks, 
like hard drives, SSDs, or USB drives. 
The hardware (like a hard drive or SSD) that stores data in these blocks. 
It presents itself to the OS as a device that handles blocks.

Filesystem: 
A filesystem is the way an operating system organizes, stores, and retrieves data on storage devices (like hard drives, SSDs, USBs).
Think of it as a library catalog system â€“ 
it decides where each book (file) is placed, how to find it later, and how to keep it organized.

Daily-Life Example

WhatsApp / Gallery on your phone
Photos are stored in folders like /DCIM/Camera/, /WhatsApp/Media/Images/.
Filesystem organizes them, lets you search, and remembers which photos are deleted or restored from recycle bin.

Cloud Drives (Google Drive, Dropbox)
They also use a filesystem (virtual) to store and organize your documents into folders, manage permissions (share with people), 
and allow versioning.
