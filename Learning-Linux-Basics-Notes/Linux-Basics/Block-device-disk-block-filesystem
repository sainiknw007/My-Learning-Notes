Disk Block: 
The smallest unit of data storage on a physical disk (usually 4KB). 
Think of it as a single "tile" in a giant mosaic.

Block Device: (hardware device that stores data in fixed-size blocks,)
A block device in Linux is a type of hardware device that stores data in fixed-size blocks, 
like hard drives, SSDs, or USB drives. 
The hardware (like a hard drive or SSD) that stores data in these blocks. 
It presents itself to the OS as a device that handles blocks.

Filesystem: 
The organizational structure that manages how data is stored and retrieved on the block device. 
It uses disk blocks to store files, directories, and metadata, acting like a "map" for the data.
