Linux Boot Process can be broken down into 4 stages:

First Step/Process is BIOS POST
2nd Boot Loader or GRUB2
3rd is Kernel initialization
4th is Service initialization using systemd INIT Process


How to initializde Linux boot process:

2 ways

Start a Linux system when it is in halted state or stopped state.
2nd is reboot or reset a running system.

1st Step: 

BIOS POST:
POST stands for Poweron self test, BIOS runs a POST test to ensure that the hardware components attached to the devices are functioning correctly.

If POST fails, the computer may not be operable and the system will not proceed to the second stage of the boot process.

2nd Step:
The next step after BIOS POST is Boot loader, after successfull POST test the BIOS loads and executes the boot code from the boot devices, which is located in the 
first sector of the hard disk.

In Linux, this is located under /Boot file system.
the Boot loader provides the user with the boot screen to select OS to boot.
Like ubunut 18.04 

Once the selection is made, Boot loader loads the kernel into the memory and supply some parameters to kernel.
And Handover control to kernel.

Popular example of Boot Loader is GRUB2 - GRUB2 stands for Grand unified Bootloader 2
GRUB2 is primary boot loader for most current linux distributions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3rd step:
After the Kernel is loaded into memory.
it is decompressed, since kernel is in compressed state to converse space.
then kernel is loaded into memory and starts executing.
during this space kernel perform some task like hardware initialization, memory managemnt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4th step:
Once it is completed, Kernel looks for INIT process to run.
INIT process setup the user space and the processes needed for the user environment.

INIT function calls the systemd daemon.

the systemd is responsible for brining the Linux host to a usable state.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Systemd:

Systemd is responsible for bringing the liux host to  a usable state.
