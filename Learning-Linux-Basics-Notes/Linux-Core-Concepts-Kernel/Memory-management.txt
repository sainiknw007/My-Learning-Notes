One of the significant function of Linux Kernel is Memory management.

how memory is separated within the Linux Kernel.

Memory is divided into two areas known as
1).Kernel Space / kernel mode
2).User space  / user mode

                 User Space
────────────────────────────────────────────
   • Applications / Programs
────────────────────────────────────────────


────────────────────────────────────────────
                 Kernel Space
────────────────────────────────────────────
   • Kernel
   • Device Drivers
────────────────────────────────────────────

👉 Kernel Space is reserved for running
   - Kernel Code
   - Kernel Extensions
   - Device Drivers

👉 User Space contains:
   - Applications / Programs


1). Kernel Space: 

Kernel space is the portion of the memory in which the kernel executes (kernel runs) and provides its services.
A process running the kernel space has unrestricted access to the hardware.

Kernel space is reserved for running 
kernel code,
Kernel extensions and 
most device drivers.

2). User Space:

All processes running outside the Kernel reside in the User Space, which has restricted access to CPU and Memory.

User Space applications are programs that are written in 
C
Java
python
Ruby
or any other programming language.

Unix/Linux system occurs with prepackage application,

How programs run in the User Space:	

All Users Programs function by manipulating data, but where does this data live ?

User programs data live in memory and on disk.

What is System call ?
Ans: User Programs get access to data by making specials requests to the Kernel called system calls.

For example: Opening a file such as the /etc/os-release file to see the version of the Operating System -----> results/make in a system call to kernel

here open the file specified by pathname.

the file is located in the /etc directory which is mounted on filesystem created on a block device.

Open a file
write a file
List Processes
Defining a variable.

Example of System calls are:

open()
close()
reddir()   --> red directory.
strlen()   --> String length.
closedir() --> Close directory.
