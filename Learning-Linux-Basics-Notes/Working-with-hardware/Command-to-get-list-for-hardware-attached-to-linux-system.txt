Command to get list for hardware devices attached to the system:

1). Dmesg is tool display messages from kernel area called ring buffer.
When a Linux operating system boots up, there are messages generated by the kernel that appear on the display screen.

dmesg ---> Command

read output of dmesg command using less or find match pattern using grep command

dmesg less
dmesg more

dmesg | grep -i usb

this messages also contain logs from the hardware devices that kernel detects.

2).udevadm utility is a management tool for udev.(user space device manager daemon called udev)

3). udevadm info command queries the udev database for device information.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sda5

this command query  hard disk information attached to the system.

>udevadm monitor  command listen to the kernel uevents.

upon detecting an event, it prints the details, such as device path and device name in the screen.

this command is quite handy to determine the details of a newly attached or removed device.

4). lspci  command --> stands for List PCI Peripherical component interconnect.
this command display information about all PCI devices that are configured in the system.

Example of PCI devices are:

ethernet cable
raid controller
video cards and 
wireless adapters

that directly attached to PCI slots in the motherboard of the computer.

5).lsblk --> command lists information about block devices. here sda is the physical disk.

sda1 to sda5 are partition created for this disk.

# Check block devices (disks & partitions)
Command:
$ lsblk

Output:
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 119.2G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0   100M  0 part /boot/efi
├─sda2   8:2    0    16M  0 part
├─sda3   8:3    0  71.5G  0 part
├─sda4   8:4    0     1G  0 part
└─sda5   8:5    0  46.6G  0 part /

TYPE disk is the whole physical disk.
TYPE partition is partition of physical disk.

Major and Minor number are associated withe each device.

Major number 8 means block s disk devices.
minor number help to identify different partition for the disk sda.

Explanation:
-------------------------------------
- sda   → Physical Disk (119.2 GB total)
- sda1  → 100 MB   (EFI Boot Partition)
- sda2  → 16 MB    (Reserved)
- sda3  → 71.5 GB  (Partition)
- sda4  → 1 GB     (Partition)
- sda5  → 46.6 GB  (Mounted as "/")

 MAJOR Version   Device Type
   	1 		RAM
       3		HARD DISK or CD ROM
	6 		PARALLEL PRINTERS
 	8		SCSI DISK



# Summary:
Physical Disk = sda
Partitions    = sda1, sda2, sda3, sda4, sda5

6). To display information about CPU architecture use

lscpu command
