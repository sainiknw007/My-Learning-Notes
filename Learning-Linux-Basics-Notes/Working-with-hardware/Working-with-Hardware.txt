How Linux identify and mange hardware devices:

Example: 

Step:1). When an USB Sisk is attached to the system.
pendrive/mouse/usb keyboard/ headphones

Step:2). Corresponding device driver (which is part for kernel space) detects the state change, and generates an event.

Step:3). This Event called uevent is sent to the user space device manager daemon called udev.
udev is responsible for dynamically creating a device node associated with the newly attached drive in the /dev file system. 

Step:4). once this process is complete newly attached disk will be visible under /dev file system.
