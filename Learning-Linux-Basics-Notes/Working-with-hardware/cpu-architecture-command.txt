1). lscpu ---> display detailed information about cpu architecture.

Number of cores
threads
model etcetra.

CPU architecture popular types:

32-bit processors were used till 1990.
64-bit processors 

What is 32-bit processors ?
32-bit processor can address and store 2^32= 4GB gigabytes value in the register.

CPU register --> store temporary data, instructions, and memory addresses for cpu immediate operations.
A register is very small, high-speed storage location directly inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU).

Example: register is used to carry out data from memory and carry out arithemetic operations.

64-bit process can address and store 2^64 = 18 exaybytes.

On 32-bit CPU/processor you can run only 32-bit OS.
You cannot install 64-bit OS in a 32-bit CPU/processor architecture.
it is possible however not recommended.

32-bit CPU machine can only run 32-bit version of software.

a 64-bit CPU can run both 32-bit and 64-bit software. it is recommended to run 64-bit version if possible.

Sockets are the physical slots where you can insert a physical CPU.

Each phsyical CPU have multiple cores.

in above example number of cores are 4.
each core can run multiple thread, here 1 core can run 2 thread.

Total no. of CPUs or virtual CPUs = number of sockets x no. of cores x no. of thread
Total no. of CPUs or virtual CPUs = 1x4x2 = 8 
it means this system can run 8 parallel thread at a time. and this value 8 is seend under CPUs output.

This lscpu command shows the vendor and model of CPU.
