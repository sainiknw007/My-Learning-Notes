1). dmesg:
 	  is a tool(command) used to display messages from ring buffer (an area of kernel).
dmesg | grep -i usb
use this tool/command to filter for specific device like need usb related msg/logs.

2). udevadm utility is a management tool for udev.
udevadm info --> udev info command query udev database for device information.

udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sda5 
in this command we are querying the hard disk attached to the system.

3). udevadm monitor command listens to kernel uevents.
upon detecting an event, it prints the details, such as the device path and device name on the screen.

in the example: run udevadm monitor and check
remove usb mouse from the system.

4).  lspci - command display information about PCI devices that are configured in the system.
PCI peripheral component interconnect, example of PCI devices are ethernet cards, raid,
controllers,video cards and wireless adapters that directly attached to the PCI slots in the motherboard.

5). lsblk command list information about block devices.

$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda      8:0    0  100G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0   96G  0 part /
└─sda2   8:2    0    4G  0 part [SWAP]
sr0     11:0    1 1024M  0 rom  

6). lscpu ---> display detailed information about cpu architecture.

Number of cores
threads
model etcetra.

7).lsmem --summary 

this command is used to list the available memory in the system.

lsmem --summary 

this command is used to list the available memory in the system.

free -m   --> -m shows in MB , -k shows in KB and -g shows i Gigabytes.
free -k
free -g
free -h
this command is used to get total memory, used memory, free memory in the system.

8).lshw 

is a tool to extract detailed information on the entire hardware configuration of the machine.

it gives


Memory configuration,
firmware version,
mainboard configuration,
CPU version and speed,
cache configuration,
bus speed.

lshw gives a warning, you should run this program as super user
sudo lshw

9). ls -l /sbin/init  this tool is used to check init system used.....

ls -l /sbin/init

if it is a systemd managed system, you will see a pointer to the /lib/systemd/systemd
