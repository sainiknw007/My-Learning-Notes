Linux can run in multiple mode:
graphical mode
command line interface mode

these modes are set by run level.

To see the operation mode set in the system run the command called runlevel and you will get a number.

runlevel
N  5

runlevel 5 provides graphical interface
runlevel 3 provides command line interface 

during boot the init process checks the run level:

it make sure all programs required to get system operational in that mode are started.
For example:
Graphical user mode requires a display manager service to run for GUI mode to work.

In boot process system D is used as the init process in most Linux Distributions such as ubuntu 18.04 
In Systemd runlevels are called targets.

runlevel 5 is called Graphical target

runlevel 3 is called multiuser.target.

these are most commonly used targets.
