To see default targets run command:

systemctl get-default
graphical.target

this (systemctl get-default) command  look for file located at

/etc/systemd/system/default.target

check with ls -lrt /etc/systemd/system/default.target
/etc/systemd/system/default.target  -> /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target

default.target file is softlink/shortcut to graphical.target unit file.
this file graphical.target is located under /lib/systemd/system/ directory

To change default target we can use 

systemctl set-default command with desired target as command argument..

systemctl set-default multi-user.target --->>>

this command change the default target from graphical to multi-user target.

this is equivalent to switching the runlevel from 5 to 3.
