What is YAML ?
YAML- Yet another markup language

YAML: file is used to represent data , in Kubernetes
      it is used to represent configuration data.

How you represent Key-value Pair in YAML


Key-Value Pair: Data in simplest form 
Key and value separated by colun: and space

-----------------------
Fruit: Apple
Vegetable: Carrot
Liquid: Water
Meat: Chicken

: separated by space Key and value
Fruit is a key and value is Apple
Vegetable is key and value is Carrot
---------------------------------------

Array/List representation:

we want to represent some fruites and vegetable

Fruits:
-  Orange
-  Apple
-  Banana

Fruit is an array and - (dash)represent it is an elements of array.

Vegetable:
-  Carrot
-  Cauliflower
-  Tomato

Vegetable is an array and - represent their elements.

--------------
Dictionary: A Dictionary is a set of properties  group together under an item.
Example: we tried to represent nutrition information about 2 fruits.

Banana:
   Calories: 105
   Fat: 0.4g
   Carbs: 27m

Grapes:
	Calories: 62	
	Fat: 0.3g
	Carbs: 16m

Check space before items, check equal number of space between all items so they are all aligned together..
number of space between all properties are key..

If you give space in Fat and Carbs, it will give you syntax error


--------------------

List containing Fruits, Fruits are banana and Grapes

each fruit has its dictionary

each 

Key-Value/Dictionary/List
Fruit:
  Banana:	
     Calories: 105
     Fat: 0.4g
     Carbs: 27m
  
  Grapes:
     Calories: 62
     Fat: 0.3g
     Carbs: 16m

 

Dictionary is an unordered collection while 
list is an ordered collection

----------------------------

All XML, JSON AND YAML are used to represent data,

Dictionary vs List vs List of Dictionary

Color: Blue
Price: $20,000
Model: 
  Name: Corvette
  Year: 1995

Transmission: Manual
So, this is a dictionary and dictionary inside dictionary.

Store name of 6 car, each name has color followed by model.
to store this we use, List/array as multiple items of same type.

List of array

- Blue Corvette
- Grey Corvette
- Red Corvette
- Green Corvette
- Blue Corvette
- Black Corvette

Now want to store about all information about each car...like
each car color, model, transmission ..


- Color: Blue
  Model:
    Name: Corvette
    Year: 1995
  Transmission: Manual
  Price: $20,000

- Color: Grey
  Model: 
    Name: Corvette
    Year: 1995
  Transmission: Manual
  Price: $22,000

- Color: Red
  Model:
     Name: Corvette
     Year: 1995
  Transmission: Automatic
  Price: $20,000 

- Green Corvette
- Blue Corvette
- Black Corvette


Dictionary are unordered collection.

Dictionary/Map

Dictionary 1:

Banana: 		
  Calories: 105
  Fat: 0.4 g
  Carbs: 27 g

Dictionary 2

Banana:
  Calories: 105
  Carbs: 27 g
  Fat: 0.4 g

Pehle m Fat properties h then Carbs.. and in second: 
Pehle carbs and phir Fat. Since, Dictionary is unordered colcetion
hence both are same, if order is different


Array/List

Fruits:
- Orange
- Apple
- Banana

Array/List 2 

Fruits:
- Orange
- Banana
- Apple

Both are different, as List is ordered collection..

# List of Fruits 
# any line with # is command it is ignored and comment.



List are ordered.
